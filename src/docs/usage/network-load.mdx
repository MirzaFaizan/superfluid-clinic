### Bundle analyzer

The application bundle sizes can be evaluated and reviewed every time a app build happens for deployment.
It is considered good practice to have a look at bundle size before pushing into `production`


Source map explorer analyzes JavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code bloat is coming from.

```js 
npm install --save source-map-explorer
```

Then in `package.json`, add the following line to scripts:
```json
 "scripts": {
+    "analyze": "source-map-explorer 'build/static/js/*.js'",
     "start": "react-scripts start",
```
Then to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze script.

```bash
npm run build
npm run analyze
```

Right now. About 92.6% of the app bundle size is coming from the main react application.

### React Lazy Loading/ Code Splitting

[Code Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) should be done at superfluid dashboard routing level to bundle
the logically related components together and decrease the initial app load bundle size.

In superfluid dashboard at `Container.js` this can be achieved by using `HOC` to lazy load components on specific URL hit.

### Using CDN

The files in the `/src/static` should be served from a CDN to decrease the bundle size and faster reloading for the application.
Other static resources can be put through a similar CDN for better network performance.
