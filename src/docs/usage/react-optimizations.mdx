### Current code Optimizations

#### Structure context for different component do not bundle everything together.

right now, the `app.js` have almost rest of the react contexts wrapped around it. Which means Root component will rerender every time context state is updated.

```jsx
❌
<Router>
    <DasboardCtxProvider>
      <NotificationProvider>
        <ModalProvider>
          <CountryCtxProvider>
            <Web3CtxProvider>

              <ConverterCtxProvider>
                <LanguageCtxProvider>
                  <App />
                </LanguageCtxProvider>
              </ConverterCtxProvider>
            </Web3CtxProvider>
          </CountryCtxProvider>
        </ModalProvider>
      </NotificationProvider>
    </DasboardCtxProvider>
  </Router>,

✅
  <>
    <NotificationProvider>
        <NotificationPanel />
    </NotificationProvider>
    <CountryCtxProvider>
        <NavBar/>
    </CountryCtxProvider>
  </>
```

every context provider should pushed down to the nearest consumer.

#### use react useEffect() with deps

Many places in repo `useEffect()` is being used without providing dependency array. This can result in infinite rerednering, It is advised
to use the defined way.


#### write business logic in utils

Ref: `useConnectWeb3` and rest...
whenever you are using hooks use them to store states only, for any logical and busniess operations make seprate utils and call them inside your hook.
only use `use` prefix with react file names or fucntions when you are intented to share the state with some other components.


#### Using service workers

There are many events and dispatches in the repo for them using *service worker* would be a better option 
service workers can recognize push event based `keypresses` and all the thread heavy functions can be served from that *service workers*﻿
use service worker for handling events this will make them run on a totally different thread https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval


#### Remove API calls from contexts

Ref: `Web3Context` and rest...

Tear down the API calls from Contexts to utils and just keep states on top use utils or custom hooks to update the states.
