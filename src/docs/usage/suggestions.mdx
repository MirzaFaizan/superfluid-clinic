### Internal Code base suggestions

#### Use react-window / virtualization

for the Screen `/transaction-history` using `react-window` or any sort of virtualization would be a better option for long lists.
Virtualization enables the app to only display components withinthe viewport. Which results in much less workload for main thread to deal with.

[react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window)


#### use absolute paths

To import modules or other components use import path `e.g ‘/src/components/…'`
This will ensure that even after moving a component from one dir to another it will still have import paths from one aboslute base path.

```jsx
❌
import { withRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import CANCEL from "../../static/gifs/cancel_streaming.gif";
import TETRIS from "../../static/gifs/tetris_streaming.gif";

✅
import CANCEL from "/src/static/gifs/cancel_streaming.gif";
import TETRIS from "/src/static/gifs/tetris_streaming.gif";

```


#### Folder Structure

use a views folder to denote the entry component for every screen.
views folder to have main components where you can make API calls that are necessary or even import context where needed.


```
src
|-components
| |-[componentName]
|   |-componentUI.js
|   |-componentStyle.js
|   |-componentLogic.js (hooks)
|
|-views
|   |-viewName.js
|
```


#### stick to only one ecma standard 

Ref: `useConnectWeb3.js :54`
Avoid using ES5 and ES6 in the same code base.

```js
❌
    let a = 1;
    var b = 2;
✅
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
```


#### use a spellchecker in dev environment 
Ref: `ButtonPanel :139`
There are some basic spell mistakes that can be avoiding by using the spellchecker integrated in the IDE.

My favourite one is [Spellchecker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker#:~:text=Open%20up%20VS%20Code%20and,and%20reload%20window%20to%20enable.)


#### apply stronger eslint rules
Apply stronger eslint lint rules and verify the linting and code consistency before psuhing.
add a linting hook to `husky` pre-commit.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "react"
  ],
  "extends": ["eslint:all", "plugin:react/all"]
}
```

#### structure of component
- Move style for each component in a separate file.
- Separate business logic in hooks from UI
- Write component level documentation


#### Hook with loading and error flags for API calls
It is better to have a separate hook for making API calls with different flags like `loading`, `err` useEffect

an example can be 

```js
const useFetch = (url, options) => {
  const [response, setResponse] = React.useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const res = await fetch(url, options);
        const json = await res.json();
        setResponse(json);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
      }
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);
  return { response, error };
};
```
