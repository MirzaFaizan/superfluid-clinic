### current performance on light house

The application loads with first contentful paint after around 3-4 Mbs of bundle downloading

- 23 static resources are being fetched from the server `/src/static` folder
- Images do not have `Alt` Attribute.

Biggest JS chunks from the first app load.

```md title=bundleSizes
…js/2.1c383f69.chunk.js(app.superfluid.finance) 2,055 KiB
.../build/react_devtools_backend.js 437.9 KiB
/modules.851cc60….js(script.hotjar.com) 118.3 KiB
…js/main.b881ee03.chunk.js(app.superfluid.finance) 221.7 KiB
/frame-modern.800ccd99.js(js.intercomcdn.com) 132.7 KiB
```

The app lack some features for a being a PWA.
